Freelance Availability Widget
============================= 
This plugin is a widget to show on sites run by freelancers their availability for paid work.
 
Description
===========
 
This plugin allows you to display a widget on any widget enabled area on your WordPress site detailing whether or not you are available for paid work at the current time. This is useful should you be in a position whereby you are so busy you are unavailable for work, saving clients and yourself time.

You can choose to add a contact form or a URL to a contact us page.

There is also a shortcode for showing the global availablity. 

You can see it in action on my site for my freelance WordPress development business, [Dwi'n Rhys](https://dwinrhys.com).

Installation
============
1. Upload the plugin to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or use the Add New feature.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings > Freelance Availablity Widget to set when you are available soon or available.
