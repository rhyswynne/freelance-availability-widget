This plugin is a widget to show on sites run by freelancers their availability for paid work.
 
== Description ==
 
This plugin allows you to display a widget on any widget enabled area on your WordPress site detailing whether or not you are available for paid work at the current time. This is useful should you be in a position whereby you are so busy you are unavailable for work, saving clients and yourself time.

You can see it in action on my freelance WordPress development business' website, [Dwi'n Rhys](https://dwinrhys.com/?utm_source=wordpress-readme&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=freelance-availability-widget).
